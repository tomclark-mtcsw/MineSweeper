# MineSweeper
During the 2020 COVID layoff, I interviewed with a company I was interested in and they gave me this little programming assignment during the interview.
I mocked up some methods and a couple of simple classes to show them how I would solve the problem.  It was kind of fun, so I finished the project
to the point that it's functional and shows the basics of it working.  It is by no means meant to be something public.  But it shows a solution
to a simple problem.  You might find it enjoyable.
